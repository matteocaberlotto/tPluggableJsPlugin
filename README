This plugin allows dev to use jquery scripts into page before the framework itself is included.

Scenario:
- i need to use some custom js code with also dependencies to dynamic elements but i dont want to add 1 action to serve that js.

Solution:
- append js snippets to an object that gets executed at dom ready

Sample:
(after having activated the plugin)

<script>
pluggable.init.myEvent = function()
{
	alert('This gets executed at dom ready');
}
</script>

Object name ('pluggable') is configurable
