this allows to write jquery javascript into html page.
for performance reasons jquery get loaded at page end and is not available into previous elements.
it is also sometimes required to lower http requests for js code snippets.
for those reasons sometimes it is required to write js code into page and this comes handy with dynamic js too.

Sample:
(after having activated the plugin)

<script>
pluggable.init.myEvent = function()
{
	alert('This gets executed at dom ready');
}
</script>

Object name ('pluggable') is configurable
